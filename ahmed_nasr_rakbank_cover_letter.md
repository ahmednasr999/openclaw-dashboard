RAKBANK
Dubai, United Arab Emirates

**RE: Vice President & Head of Frontline Experience, Onboarding Transformation & Alternate Channels**

---

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Vice President & Head of Frontline Experience position at RAKBANK. After reviewing the role requirements, I am confident that my 20-year track record delivering large-scale transformation programmes—specifically in customer onboarding, regulatory compliance, and alternate channel deployment—aligns directly with your mandate to transform frontline sales and acquisition across retail banking channels.

**Why This Role, Why Now**

RAKBANK's stated focus on eliminating pain points in the customer journey and harmonizing processes across branches, kiosks, and digital partnerships mirrors challenges I have solved at scale. At TopMed, I led the standardization of patient onboarding across 50+ facilities in 8 countries, achieving a 35% reduction in admission time while maintaining full regulatory compliance. At PaySky, I built the merchant onboarding infrastructure that processed 10,000+ new accounts monthly with automated KYC/AML workflows. These experiences have prepared me to deliver immediate impact on your onboarding transformation agenda.

**What I Bring to RAKBANK**

**1. Proven Onboarding Transformation at Scale**

At Talabat, I transformed a 7-day manual onboarding process into a 2-hour digital journey, scaling operations 233x while reducing abandonment by 45%. I understand the mechanics of journey mapping, pain point elimination, and the change management required to shift from legacy processes to modern, customer-centric workflows. This experience translates directly to your branch and kiosk transformation objectives.

**2. Deep Regulatory and Compliance Expertise**

My work at PaySky required building CDD frameworks that met Central Bank UAE and SAMA standards. I have hands-on experience with digital identity verification, KYC automation, and AML monitoring systems—the technical foundations of compliant customer acquisition in banking. I understand the balance between regulatory rigor and customer experience, and I have delivered both.

**3. Programme Governance for Complex, Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives**

As PMO Lead at TopMed, I govern a AED 50M+ annual technology budget with 98% on-time delivery. I have built the governance structures, reporting frameworks, and stakeholder alignment processes required to deliver transformation programmes of the scope you describe. I am comfortable presenting to executive committees and managing board-level expectations.

**4. Data-Driven Approach to CX Design**

I do not design journeys based on assumptions. At TopMed, I implemented analytics-driven patient journey mapping that identified and eliminated 12 critical pain points. I have built the performance dashboards, metrics frameworks, and feedback loops required to continuously optimize acquisition channels and customer experience.

**5. Regional Market Knowledge**

I am based in Dubai and have operated across GCC markets for over a decade. I understand the regulatory landscape, customer expectations, and competitive dynamics of UAE retail banking. This local context will accelerate my ability to deliver results.

**My Assessment of the Opportunity**

The RAKBANK role represents a logical progression of my career trajectory—from manufacturing excellence at Intel, to enterprise technology at Microsoft, to fintech operations at PaySky, to large-scale transformation at TopMed. I have consistently delivered results in complex, regulated environments requiring stakeholder alignment, change management, and data-driven decision making.

The banking sector is where I intend to focus my next chapter. The convergence of digital transformation, regulatory evolution, and customer experience innovation in retail banking presents the type of challenge I am built to solve. RAKBANK's position as a progressive, digitally-focused bank makes it an attractive platform for this work.

**What I Need to Succeed**

I will require executive sponsorship and clear mandate to drive change. Transformation at this scale cannot succeed without alignment at the EVP and Board level. I will need authority to make decisions on vendor selection, process redesign, and organizational change. With that support, I have consistently delivered 2-3x improvement in key metrics within 12-18 months.

**Next Steps**

I am available for discussion at your convenience and can provide references from my work at PaySky and TopMed upon request. I have attached my CV for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to RAKBANK's frontline transformation objectives.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

**Ahmed Nasr**
