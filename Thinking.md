## 🎯 ACTIVE THINKING

### Job Search Strategy

- Which companies should I prioritize this week?
- What's my narrative: Technical PM vs Strategy vs Transformation?

### ANCO Consulting
- First client target: Healthcare or FinTech?
- Pricing psychology: Premium positioning vs market rate?
- Partnership angle: Big 4 subcontractor or direct?

### Content & Thought Leadership
- What's the ONE story that defines my brand?
- LinkedIn: Quality engagement vs volume posts?
- Newsletter: Weekly commitment realistic?

## 🧠 PROBLEMS I'M CHEWING ON

1. **Time allocation:** Job search vs ANCO vs content - what's the 80/20?

2. **Positioning:** Am I a PM who understands AI, or an AI strategist who can PM?

3. **Risk tolerance:** Take the 6-month contract (RiskPod) or hold for permanent $150K?

4. **Geography:** Dubai priority, but should I consider Riyadh offers?
