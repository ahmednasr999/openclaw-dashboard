## 🎯 ACTIVE THINKING

### Job Search Strategy
- What differentiates me from other $130K+ PM candidates?
- Which companies should I prioritize this week?
- What's my narrative: Technical PM vs Strategy vs Transformation?

### ANCO Consulting
- First client target: Healthcare or FinTech?
- Pricing psychology: Premium positioning vs market rate?
- Partnership angle: Big 4 subcontractor or direct?

### Content & Thought Leadership
- What's the ONE story that defines my brand?
- LinkedIn: Quality engagement vs volume posts?
- Newsletter: Weekly commitment realistic?

## 🧠 PROBLEMS I'M CHEWING ON

1. **Time allocation:** Job search vs ANCO vs content - what's the 80/20?

2. **Positioning:** Am I a PM who understands AI, or an AI strategist who can PM?

3. **Risk tolerance:** Take the 6-month contract (RiskPod) or hold for permanent $150K?

4. **Geography:** Dubai priority, but should I consider Riyadh offers?

## 🚀 WORKFLOW AUTOMATION IDEAS

### CV Creation Pipeline (2026-02-10)
**Current state:** Built CV-tailor skill, job-tracker skill, Google Sheets integration

**Goal:** Make CV creation smarter, more automated, less cost

**Current workflow:**
1. Send LinkedIn job link + JD
2. I parse requirements
3. Match to profile
4. Generate tailored CV
5. Add to Google Sheet (Row X)
6. GitHub commit

**Desired improvements:**
- [ ] Auto-parse JD without manual input
- [ ] ATS score optimization built-in
- [ ] Batch process multiple jobs at once
- [ ] Lower API costs (use local models where possible)
- [ ] Auto-generate cover letters in same flow
- [ ] Smart prioritization (auto-rank jobs by fit)

**Constraints:**
- No new API purchases
- Maximize existing infrastructure
- Keep quality high

**Next step:** Review current cost structure, identify optimization points
