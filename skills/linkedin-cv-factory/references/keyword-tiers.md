## Keyword Identification Process

1. **Extract from Job Description:**
   - Copy all technical requirements
   - List required/preferred qualifications
   - Note industry-specific terms
   - Identify repeated terms (higher priority)

2. **Categorize by Frequency:**
   - Listed in "Requirements" → T1
   - Listed in "Preferred" or mentioned 2+ times → T2
   - Listed in "Nice to have" or implied → T3

3. **Map to Master CV:**
   - Can directly match → Use at appropriate tier level
   - Can reframe/rephrase → Use at one tier lower
   - Cannot match honestly → Do not include

## Density Guidelines

- **T1:** 3-5 mentions per keyword (don't overstuff)
- **T2:** 2-3 mentions per keyword
- **T3:** 1-2 mentions per keyword

**Total keyword density:** 15-25% of content (not including common words)
