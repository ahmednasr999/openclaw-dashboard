2:47 AM. System lockup. 7 million orders at stake.

That's not a drill. That's Tuesday at Talabat.

We were 48 hours from launch. The new order management system—my baby, my mandate—started choking under production load. Not a little hiccup. Full cardiac arrest.

The engineering team was ready to rollback. Safe play. Smart play.

But I'd run 300+ projects at EMP. I knew this pattern. The system wasn't broken—it was suffocating.

I called an audible.

While they prepped the rollback (Plan B in my pocket), I worked with the dev leads to:
• Strip non-critical sync processes
• Implement emergency caching layer  
• Parallelize the payment verification queue

Not elegant. Not pretty. But it breathed.

Launch on time. Zero downtime. 7M orders flowing through a system that was "about to fail."

Here's what nobody told me in business school:

Technical credibility isn't about writing code.

It's about knowing enough to call the right shot when everything's on fire.

It's about the CTO trusting your judgment at 2:47 AM.

It's about 233x scale-ups and 3x profit increases not because you're the smartest in the room, but because you've been in enough 2:47 AM moments to recognize the pattern.

20+ years. 3 continents. 2 hospital groups. 1 delivery platform.

Every "impossible" deadline met.
Every mandate delivered.

Not because I know React. Because I know when NOT to rollback.
