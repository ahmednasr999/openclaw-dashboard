I've watched Western consulting firms enter Saudi for 5 years now.

They bring slick decks. Generic frameworks. Teams that fly in Monday, out Thursday.

And they wonder why transformation stalls at 30%.

Here's what I learned implementing AI across Saudi German Hospital Group:

Local context isn't a nice-to-have. It's the whole game.

When we rolled out AI-powered patient triage, the tech worked perfectly. Adoption? 15%.

The problem wasn't the algorithm. It was that nurses didn't trust a "black box" making clinical decisions they'd spent decades mastering.

We pivoted. Not the technology—the approach.

Instead of "AI will help you," we said "AI will document what you already know, so you can focus on what machines can't do."

Adoption hit 87% in 6 weeks.

The difference?

Respecting that expertise exists here. Deeply. It's just different expertise.

Western consultants sell best practices.
GCC transformation requires best fit.

The firms that get this—Booz, local players, a few boutique shops—are winning the mandates that matter.

The rest are leaving money on the table and wondering why.

Saudi Vision 2030 isn't looking for consultants who understand healthcare.

It's looking for partners who understand Saudi healthcare.

There's a difference.
