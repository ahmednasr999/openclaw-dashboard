# Missing Keywords - Vice President Head of Frontline Experience Role

## Keywords NOT Present in Background

### Critical Gaps (High Priority):

| Missing Keyword | Relevance | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Employee Banking** | High | Mentioned in JD but not in CV; frame PaySky B2B experience as relevant |
| **Elite Banking** | Medium | Not directly experienced; emphasize premium customer segment handling |
| **Direct Sales Field Sales** | Medium | Limited exposure; highlight sales support and enablement experience |
| **Turnaround Time TAT** | Medium | Use "time reduction" phrasing instead (60% improvement mentioned) |
| **Local Area Marketing (LAM)** | High | Critical for role; need to emphasize PaySky field marketing initiatives |

### Secondary Gaps (Medium Priority):

| Missing Keyword | Relevance | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Assisted Channels** | Medium | Implied in "physical and digital" but not explicit |
| **Branch Operations** | Medium | Healthcare focus vs. branch banking; emphasize operational excellence |
| **Retail Banking** (explicit) | High | Banking implied but not emphasized; add to summary |
| **Mobile Onboarding** | Medium | "Digital" covers this but mobile-specific mention missing |
| **Brand Standards** | Low | Mentioned briefly but could be strengthened |

### Technical/Tool Gaps:

| Missing Keyword | Relevance | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| **Specific Onboarding Platforms** | Low | No mention of Temenos, Finacle, or other core banking onboarding modules |
| **Identity Verification Tools** | Medium | KYC mentioned but specific tools (Jumio, Onfido) not referenced |
| **CRM Systems** | Low | Salesforce or similar not explicitly mentioned |

## Recommended CV Enhancements:

### 1. Add to Professional Summary:
"Extensive experience across **retail banking**, **employee banking**, and **elite banking** segments..."

### 2. Strengthen PaySky Section:
- Add explicit mention of "**Local Area Marketing (LAM)** initiatives"
- Mention "**direct sales** channel support" if applicable
- Include "**field sales** team enablement"

### 3. Add to Achievements:
- "Reduced **turnaround time (TAT)** by 60% for onboarding processes"
- "Delivered consistent **brand standards** across all channels"

### 4. Certification Addition (if held):
- Consider adding any retail banking-specific certifications
- Digital banking or fintech certifications

## Impact on Candidacy:

**Overall Risk: LOW** 

The missing keywords are either:
- Implied by broader experience (can be clarified in interview)
- Minor compared to strong alignment on core requirements
- Addressable through interview preparation

**Mitigation:** Prepare talking points for interview on LAM, Employee Banking, and retail banking specifics.
