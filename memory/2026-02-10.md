- Real data only, never fictional
- Google Sheets preferred over Notion
- Dark theme, Kanban layout, iPhone-first
- Manual job application submission (I prepare, he submits)

## Decisions Made

1. **Memory structure** - Daily logs + long-term MEMORY.md
2. **Security model** - Explicit approval, allowlist-based
3. **Subagent strategy** - Spawn for >30 sec tasks
4. **Group chat rules** - Speak when valuable, silent when not
5. **Heartbeat approach** - Proactive checks, not just OK
