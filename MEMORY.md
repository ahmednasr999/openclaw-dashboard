## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- CV-tailor skill with real data integration
- Google Sheets API for job tracking
- GitHub auto-deploy for dashboard
- Sample-first approach builds trust

**What to avoid:**
- Notion API (hit limitations early)
- LinkedIn scraping (blocked, use manual)
- Fictional examples in CVs
- Multiple messages before user response

**Mistakes not to repeat:**
- Don't proceed without explicit approval
- Check JSON syntax when editing config files
- Verify skill repo structure before installing
- Don't let tokens expire during batch operations
- **Local LLMs on CPU-only VPS don't work** - 2-core/8GB RAM insufficient for interactive use (20+ min response times)
- **Always test model speed before building infrastructure** - Test first, configure later
