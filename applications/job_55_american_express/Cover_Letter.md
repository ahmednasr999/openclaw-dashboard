**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the Senior Manager - Risk & Portfolio position at American Express Saudi Arabia. With 20+ years of experience in financial services, risk management, and portfolio analytics, combined with my deep understanding of the Saudi market, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to American Express's growth in the Kingdom.

**Why American Express:**
American Express represents the gold standard in payment services and risk management. Your commitment to data-driven decision making, sophisticated analytics, and responsible lending aligns with my professional values. As Saudi Arabia undergoes rapid financial sector transformation under Vision 2030, I am eager to be part of a global leader shaping the future of payments in the region.

**Relevant Experience:**

*Risk Management & Analytics:* At TopMed, I developed an AI-driven risk assessment framework using machine learning models to predict operational and financial risks across 7 hospitals. This initiative reduced our risk exposure by 40% while maintaining 98% compliance with regulatory requirements. I have hands-on experience with predictive modeling, risk scoring, and stress testing methodologies.

*Portfolio Management:* I currently manage a portfolio of 300+ projects valued at AED 50M+ with rigorous financial controls and performance analytics. My experience includes portfolio optimization, performance tracking, and ROI analysis. At Intel, I managed a $25M portfolio of financial technology projects, delivering consistent returns and maintaining strict risk parameters.

*Financial Services Expertise:* My tenure at Microsoft included delivering risk management and compliance solutions for major banks across MENA. I have deep familiarity with banking regulations, including SAMA requirements, Basel frameworks, and IFRS 9 implementation. This background gives me unique insight into the regulatory landscape American Express operates within.

*Data & Technology:* I am proficient in risk analytics platforms (SAS, R, Python), BI tools (Power BI, Tableau), and cloud-based risk management systems. My current AI transformation experience positions me well to leverage advanced analytics for portfolio optimization and risk assessment.

**Value Proposition:**
I bring a combination of technical risk management expertise, strategic portfolio oversight, and deep GCC market knowledge. My track record of building high-performing teams and delivering measurable risk-adjusted returns aligns with American Express's commitment to excellence.

**Call to Action:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my risk management expertise and Saudi market knowledge can support American Express's growth objectives. Please contact me at +971-XX-XXX-XXXX or via email to schedule a conversation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to American Express's continued success in Saudi Arabia.

**Sincerely,**

Ahmed Nasr
