Hiring Committee
Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB)
Dubai, UAE

**RE: Application for Manager – Customer Lifecycle Strategy & Governance**

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Manager – Customer Lifecycle Strategy & Governance position at Dubai Islamic Bank. With 20+ years designing customer engagement frameworks, implementing governance structures, and driving cross-functional coordination across healthcare, FinTech, and banking sectors, I am confident in my ability to lead DIB's customer management framework and lifecycle orchestration initiatives.

**Directly Addressing Your Requirements:**

Your posting emphasizes **customer lifecycle strategy and governance**—core competencies I have developed leading enterprise-wide digital transformations. At TopMed (Saudi German Hospital Group), I spearheaded patient engagement platform implementation across 10+ hospitals, designing lifecycle logic, touchpoint triggers, and contact governance policies that mirror the banking customer lifecycle challenges DIB faces. This experience translating strategic segmentation into operational journey execution directly aligns with your mandate to link segmentation strategy with lifecycle journeys.

Your need for **cross-functional coordination between strategy and execution teams** matches my proven track record. As Country Manager at PaySky, I built customer management frameworks linking merchant segmentation with engagement priorities, coordinating between product, risk, and marketing teams—exactly the stakeholder alignment this role requires. I established contact governance covering frequency prioritization and channel hierarchy, ensuring consistent customer-centric engagement across B2B and B2C segments.

**Relevant Achievements:**

- **Governance Framework Development:** Built PMO structures from scratch at EMP (banking) and TopMed (healthcare), establishing documentation standards, performance dashboards, and compliance frameworks (JCI, HIMSS, MOH, banking regulations)
- **Lifecycle Orchestration at Scale:** Scaled Talabat operations 233x (30K to 7M daily orders) through customer journey optimization and engagement trigger implementation
- **Data-Driven Optimization:** Delivered 95% platform adoption at TopMed within 6 months through quarterly performance reviews, journey optimization, and continuous improvement methodologies
- **Strategic Planning:** Advised C-suite at El Araby Group on multi-year strategic business plans, ensuring organizational alignment across diverse business units

**Why DIB:**

DIB's commitment to Islamic banking principles combined with digital transformation leadership presents a unique opportunity to apply my customer strategy expertise within a values-driven framework. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of designing lifecycle governance that respects customer preferences while driving engagement—balancing compliance, privacy, and customer-centricity.

**Consulting Background:**

While my career has focused on operational leadership rather than traditional management consulting, my approach embodies consulting discipline: framework development, stakeholder alignment, data-driven decision-making, and measurable outcomes. My experience spans the full customer lifecycle spectrum—from acquisition (PaySky) to engagement (Talabat) to retention and optimization (TopMed)—providing the 360-degree perspective this role demands.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in customer lifecycle management, governance framework development, and cross-functional leadership can contribute to DIB's strategic objectives. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ahmed Nasr
