**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Digital Transformation Director position at PwC Strategy&. With 20+ years of experience leading enterprise transformation initiatives at Fortune 500 companies and across GCC markets, combined with my management consulting background, I am excited about the opportunity to join the world's leading strategy consulting firm.

**Why PwC Strategy&:**
Strategy& represents the pinnacle of strategic consulting, combining deep industry expertise with cutting-edge methodologies to help clients solve their most complex challenges. Your work in digital transformation across the GCC, particularly in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiatives, aligns perfectly with my experience and aspirations. The opportunity to work alongside the brightest minds in consulting and deliver transformative impact at scale is exactly the next step I am seeking in my career.

**Relevant Experience:**

*Consulting Excellence:* I began my career in management consulting, developing foundational expertise in top-tier consulting methodologies, client engagement models, and value-driven problem solving. At Intel, I led a digital transformation consulting practice with a P&L of $40M+, delivering 50+ engagements that generated $150M+ in client value. This experience honed my ability to advise C-suite executives and deliver measurable business outcomes.

*Digital Transformation Leadership:* My current role leading AI transformation at Saudi German Hospital Group demonstrates my ability to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation. I manage a portfolio of 300+ projects valued at AED 50M+, driving 233x scalability improvements and 3x profitability increases. This hands-on transformation experience gives me practical insight that I can bring to Strategy& client engagements.

*GCC Market Expertise:* I have deep experience across Saudi Arabia, UAE, and wider GCC markets. I have advised government entities, healthcare organizations, and financial institutions on digital strategy and transformation. I understand the unique business, cultural, and regulatory dynamics of the region and have built strong relationships with key decision-makers.

*Thought Leadership:* I am a published author on digital transformation in Forbes Middle East and Harvard Business Review Arabic. I am a keynote speaker at GITEX, Arab Health, and World Government Summit. This thought leadership platform demonstrates my ability to shape industry conversations and build credibility with senior clients.

*Team Leadership:* I have built and led high-performing consulting and delivery teams throughout my career. I understand the importance of developing talent, fostering collaboration, and maintaining the highest standards of excellence that Strategy& clients expect.

**Value Proposition:**
I bring a rare combination of consulting methodology expertise, hands-on transformation experience, and deep GCC market knowledge. I can credibly advise clients on digital strategy while understanding the practical realities of implementation. My track record of delivering measurable business outcomes and my established thought leadership position me to contribute immediately to Strategy&'s client engagements and practice development.

**Call to Action:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Strategy&'s continued growth and success in the GCC. Please contact me at +971-XX-XXX-XXXX or via email to arrange a conversation.
