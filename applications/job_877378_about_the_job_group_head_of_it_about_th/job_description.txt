About the job
Group Head of IT - Dubai
About the Role:
My client is looking for a hands-on Group Head of IT / Systems Lead to personally design, implement, and manage core platforms across multiple entities within their private investment group. This is not a traditional IT leadership role, it’s ideal for someone who thrives close to investment teams and enjoys turning system design directly into operational solutions.
Key Responsibilities:
Design, implement, and own group-wide systems, including:
CRM platforms for deal flow, investors, and relationships
Finance and accounting systems across entities
Practical cybersecurity standards and risk management across the group
Work directly with investment and portfolio teams to optimise workflows.
Take full ownership of day-to-day system operations, configurations, and updates.
Collaborate with external vendors where necessary, while maintaining a hands-on approach.
Ensure systems support efficient decision-making, reporting, and secure operations across the group.
Ideal Candidate:
Experience in investment, private equity, family office, or VC environments.
Comfortable with end-to-end system implementation and management.
Strong understanding of investment workflows, portfolio operations, and deal processes.
Hands-on technical skills, able to move from design to execution independently.
Knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and practical implementation for small-to-medium group environments.
Strong communication skills and the ability to work with senior stakeholders.
Why This Role is Different:
You are not managing a large IT department, you are the hands-on systems owner across the group.
Directly influence how investment, finance, and operational workflows run.
Drive practical cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data.
Work in a dynamic, entrepreneurial investment environment.
Competitive package and autonomy to shape the systems landscape.
