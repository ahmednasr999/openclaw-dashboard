## Honest Assessment

### ⚠️ SIGNIFICANT GAPS

**1. Role Seniority Mismatch**
- **Required:** 12+ years in solutions consulting/pre-sales leadership
- **Your Profile:** 20+ years total, but ~5 years of dedicated solutions architecture
- **Reality:** Your experience is broader (PMO, Country Manager, Strategy) rather than deep pre-sales specialization

**2. Domain Depth Gap**
- **Required:** Deep card issuing, tokenization, 3DS expertise
- **Your Profile:** EMP (2014-2017) gave foundational banking exposure, but not current card-specific depth
- **Reality:** PaySky was payment platforms, not specifically card issuing infrastructure

**3. Team Leadership Mismatch**
- **Required:** Lead a team of solution architects and BAs specifically
- **Your Profile:** Led PMOs, cross-functional teams, country operations
- **Reality:** You've managed technical people, but not dedicated solutions consulting teams

**4. Function-Specific Metrics**
- **Required:** Win rates, estimate accuracy, time to live tracking
- **Your Profile:** General delivery metrics, P&L management
- **Reality:** Not explicitly tracked pre-sales funnel metrics

## Recommendation

### **MODERATE FIT** (68% ATS Score)

**Verdict:** This is a **STRETCH role** that would require significant onboarding and learning. You have ~60-70% of the requirements, but the 30-40% gap is in specialized domain knowledge (deep card issuing) and specific function experience (pre-sales team leadership).

**Risk Factors:**
- Tokenization and 3DS knowledge gaps would be visible in technical interviews
- Team leadership at this scale in solutions consulting is unproven
- Card industry currency (last deep exposure 2014-2017)

**Potential Path:**
This might work if:
1. NymCard values broader transformation experience over deep card specialization
2. They're willing to invest in domain training
3. Your leadership and process skills offset technical depth gaps
4. You can demonstrate rapid learning in technical assessment

### Alternative Angles:

**1. Apply anyway with transparent cover letter:**
"While my card issuing depth is foundational rather than current, my solutions consulting process expertise, API platform leadership, and proven ability to build high-performing technical teams position me to scale NymCard's solutions function with structured methodology."

**2. Target different role at NymCard:**
Consider if they have:
- Implementation/Delivery Lead roles
- Solution Architect (individual contributor) roles
- PMO/Program Management roles

These might be better fits for your actual experience.

**3. Bridge role elsewhere:**
Consider roles that explicitly value:
- "Payment platform experience" (broader than card issuing)
- "Solutions delivery" (vs pure pre-sales)
- "FinTech leadership" (vs card-specific)

## Tailoring Decisions Made

**What I emphasized:**
1. **Solutions consulting language** — Reframed all roles through solutions lens
2. **Process standardization** — Your PMO strength
3. **SOW/discovery expertise** — Strong match area
4. **API-first platforms** — PaySky relevance
5. **Team leadership** — Geography-spanning experience

**What I couldn't fix:**
- 12+ years dedicated solutions consulting claim (would be misleading)
- Deep card issuing expertise (EMP was 2014-2017)
- Tokenization/3DS experience (genuinely missing)
- Pre-sales funnel metrics (not tracked in your roles)

---

## Cover Letter Strategy (If You Proceed)

**Lead with:**
"20+ years delivering complex technology solutions with 5+ years focused on solutions architecture, SOW development, and API platform integration across FinTech and banking sectors."

**Address gaps head-on:**
"While my most recent card issuing depth was at EMP (2014-2017), my payment platform leadership at PaySky and API integration expertise at TopMed provide the technical foundation to rapidly master NymCard's specific domain. My strength is building scalable solutions processes and teams—which aligns with NymCard's standardization goals."

**Close with:**
"I'm drawn to NymCard's mission and culture. My broader transformation background might bring fresh perspective to your solutions consulting function, even as I close specific card industry knowledge gaps."
