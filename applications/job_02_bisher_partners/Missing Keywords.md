# Missing Keywords - Senior Advisory Partner - Institutional Transformation

## Critical Missing Keywords

### High Priority to Add
1. **Partner-Level / Partner Track** - Core to the role identity
   - *Suggestion:* Add to headline: "Senior Advisory Partner | Transformation & Growth"
   - *Evidence:* Frame current role as "functioning at partner level"

2. **Executive-in-Residence** - Specific role terminology
   - *Suggestion:* Add to Executive Profile: "Experience as Executive-in-Residence for portfolio companies"
   - *Context:* Frame advisory roles at PaySky/Soleek as EiR experience

3. **Saudi Arabia / KSA** - Critical geography focus
   - *Suggestion:* Add explicit Saudi project examples
   - *Evidence:* "Led Saudi German Hospital Group transformation across KSA operations"
   - *Gap:* Has GCC but needs Saudi emphasis

4. **Mandates** - Institutional terminology
   - *Suggestion:* Use "Led institutional mandates across company formation, market entry..."
   - *Context:* Replace "projects" with "mandates" where appropriate

5. **Portfolio** - Investment/Advisory language
   - *Suggestion:* "Advised portfolio companies across fintech and healthcare sectors"
   - *Evidence:* PaySky, Soleek, other ventures

### Medium Priority
6. **Deal Flow** - Investment terminology
   - *Suggestion:* If applicable: "Evaluated 20+ opportunities for strategic investment"
   - *Context:* May not have direct experience—use carefully

7. **Value Creation** - Private equity terminology
   - *Suggestion:* "Delivered measurable value creation: 3x profit increase, 5% revenue growth"
   - *Evidence:* Strong metrics already, reframe language

8. **Due Diligence** - Transaction support
   - *Suggestion:* "Led technology and operational due diligence for M&A transactions"
   - *Evidence:* M&A experience exists, frame explicitly

9. **Exit Strategy** - Venture/investment cycle
   - *Suggestion:* If applicable, mention exit planning or IPO preparation
   - *Context:* May not have direct experience

10. **Fundraising / Capital Raising** - Startup focus
    - *Suggestion:* "Supported fundraising efforts for portfolio companies"
    - *Evidence:* Payment platform work, startup exposure

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
11. **LP Relations** (Limited Partner) - If applicable
12. **Carry / Co-invest** - Partner compensation concepts
13. **Sector Agnostic** - Cross-industry capability
14. **Family Office** - Regional investor type
15. **Sovereign Wealth** - GCC context
