Subject: Senior Advisory Partner - Institutional Transformation Application

Dear Bisher & Partners Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the Senior Advisory Partner - Institutional Transformation position at Bisher & Partners.

With 20+ years as an operator and advisor across healthcare and fintech in the GCC, I've built a track record of creating measurable value at the institutional level:

→ Led transformation as Executive-in-Residence across 6 countries at Saudi German Hospital Group, achieving 95% AI adoption and 3x profit growth
→ Built $12.4B payment platform at PaySky, advising on fundraising and M&A strategy
→ Delivered corporate restructuring across 5 business units at El Araby Group ($800M+ revenue), driving 5% improvement
→ Deep Saudi Arabia expertise with successful market entry and operational scaling experience

I operate at the C-level and Board level, leading institutional mandates spanning company formation, Saudi market entry, venture building, and M&A. My approach combines strategic advisory with hands-on execution—delivering outcomes, not just recommendations.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your institutional mandates and add value to your client portfolio.

Would you be available for a conversation this week or next?

Best regards,
Ahmed Nasr
