**Dear Hiring Committee,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Advisory Partner position at Bisher & Partners. With 20+ years of experience spanning Fortune 500 corporations, regional enterprise leadership, and strategic advisory roles, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your distinguished advisory practice.

**Why Bisher & Partners:**
Your firm's reputation for delivering high-impact advisory services to regional and international clients resonates deeply with my professional philosophy. I am particularly drawn to your focus on combining global best practices with deep local market expertise—a philosophy I have championed throughout my career across GCC markets.

**Relevant Experience:**

*Strategic Advisory:* At Saudi German Hospital Group, I serve as a trusted advisor to C-suite executives and the board on digital transformation, AI strategy, and technology investments totaling AED 50M+. I have advised on major strategic decisions including AI governance frameworks, digital health initiatives, and operational transformation programs.

*Consulting Background:* My tenure at Intel and Microsoft provided me with world-class consulting and advisory capabilities. I managed a $25M R&D portfolio, advised VP-level leadership on product strategy, and led engagements generating $100M+ revenue impact. This experience taught me how to deliver strategic value while building lasting client relationships.

*Practice Development:* I have built and scaled internal consulting functions, including establishing a 50+ person PMO that serves as the internal advisory arm for our hospital network. I understand the dynamics of building advisory capabilities, developing talent, and creating repeatable methodologies.

*GCC Market Expertise:* Having worked extensively across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the wider GCC region, I bring deep relationships with government entities, regulatory bodies, and industry leaders. My understanding of the cultural and business nuances of this market would be a valuable asset to Bisher & Partners' client service capabilities.

**Value Proposition:**
I bring a rare combination of global corporate experience and regional market expertise. I can help Bisher & Partners clients navigate complex transformation challenges while building sustainable competitive advantages. My track record of C-suite advisory, combined with hands-on execution capabilities, positions me to deliver immediate value to your clients.

**Call to Action:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my advisory experience and GCC market expertise can contribute to Bisher & Partners' continued growth. I am available for a conversation at your convenience and can be reached at +971-XX-XXX-XXXX or via email.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your advisory practice.

**Sincerely,**

Ahmed Nasr
