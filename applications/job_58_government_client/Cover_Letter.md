**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Manager Strategy position within the government/public sector. With 20+ years of experience leading strategic initiatives and transformation programs for government entities across GCC, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to public sector excellence in the UAE.

**Why Public Sector Strategy:**
Having worked extensively with government and quasi-government entities throughout my career, I am deeply committed to the mission of public service and the transformative impact that effective strategy can have on millions of citizens. The UAE's ambitious vision for digital government and smart cities represents a unique opportunity to shape the future of governance in the region, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to this national priority.

**Relevant Experience:**

*Government Strategy & Transformation:* At Intel, I led smart city and digital government programs across GCC, including strategic advisory for Smart Dubai initiatives. I advised ministers and senior government officials on digital transformation strategies and delivered national-level technology infrastructure projects valued at $50M+. This experience gave me deep insight into government decision-making processes and the unique challenges of public sector transformation.

*Public Sector Consulting:* At Microsoft, I delivered e-government transformation projects for ministries and government agencies across MENA. These programs included national education initiatives, healthcare technology deployments, and citizen service modernization. I developed expertise in government procurement frameworks, regulatory compliance, and multi-stakeholder program delivery.

*Strategic Planning:* My educational background includes both an MBA in Public Policy & Strategy and a Master of Public Administration (MPA). I have practical experience in strategic planning methodologies, policy development, and implementation frameworks that deliver measurable outcomes in public sector contexts.

*Stakeholder Management:* Government strategy requires exceptional stakeholder management skills, including engagement with ministers, senior officials, and multiple agencies. I have successfully navigated complex political environments, built consensus among diverse stakeholders, and delivered programs that meet both technical and political requirements.

*UAE Vision 2030 Alignment:* I have contributed to UAE Smart Government and digital transformation initiatives and understand the strategic priorities outlined in UAE Vision 2030. My current work in healthcare transformation aligns with the national agenda for world-class healthcare services.

**Value Proposition:**
I bring a unique combination of private sector strategic expertise and deep public sector experience. I understand how to apply rigorous consulting methodologies while respecting the unique constraints and requirements of government operations. My track record of delivering large-scale transformation programs with measurable impact positions me to add immediate value to your strategic initiatives.

**Call to Action:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss your strategic priorities and how my experience can support your objectives. Please contact me at +971-XX-XXX-XXXX or via email to schedule a conversation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your strategic mission.

**Sincerely,**
