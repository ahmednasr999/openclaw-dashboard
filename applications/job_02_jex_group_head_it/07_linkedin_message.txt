CONNECTION REQUEST:
-------------------
Subject: Group Head of IT Application - Ahmed Nasr

Dear [Name],

I recently applied for the Group Head of IT position through Jex Recruitment and 
wanted to connect directly.

With 18+ years of IT leadership experience including group-level governance across 
multi-entity organizations, I've delivered:

• Managed AED 50M+ technology budgets with 35% cost optimization
• Built IT organizations supporting 7-country operations
• Led cloud transformation migrating 80% of workloads
• Established governance frameworks balancing standardization with business autonomy

My experience at El Araby Group (multi-business conglomerate) and TopMed has prepared 
me well for the complexities of portfolio company IT management.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your client's needs.

Best regards,
Ahmed Nasr
