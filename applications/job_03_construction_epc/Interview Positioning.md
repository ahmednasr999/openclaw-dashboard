# Interview Positioning - Digital Transformation & AI Manager

## Core Narrative

**Theme:** "Cross-industry AI expert ready to revolutionize construction through proven digital transformation playbooks"

**Opening Statement:**
"I've delivered 95% AI adoption rates and 233x operational improvements across healthcare and fintech. While construction is new to me, the fundamentals of digital transformation — process automation, ERP integration, predictive analytics — are universal. I'm excited to apply this expertise to the construction sector's unique challenges."

## Anticipated Questions & Responses

### Q: "You don't have construction experience. Why should we hire you?"
**A:** "Construction expertise you can teach; digital transformation leadership is harder to develop. I've proven I can enter new domains — healthcare, fintech, retail — and deliver measurable AI-driven results within months. My 20+ years of pattern recognition across industries actually gives me an edge: I bring proven playbooks from high-tech sectors that construction is just beginning to adopt."

### Q: "How will you get up to speed on JD Edwards and BIM?"
**A:** "I've mastered multiple ERP platforms — SAP, Salesforce, custom systems. The fundamentals translate. I dedicate my first 30 days to deep immersion: hands-on training, shadowing operations, and building relationships with the teams who know these systems cold. My track record shows I become functional in new platforms within 60 days."

### Q: "Describe your approach to change management in resistant environments."
**A:** "At TopMed, I faced similar skepticism from clinical staff about AI. My approach: (1) Quick wins that show value, (2) Champion identification and empowerment, (3) Transparent communication about what's changing and why, (4) Training that meets people where they are. Result: 95% adoption across 6 countries."
