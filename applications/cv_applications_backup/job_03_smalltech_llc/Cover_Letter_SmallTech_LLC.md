Hiring Manager
SmallTech LLC
[Company Address]

**RE: IT Project Coordinator Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the **IT Project Coordinator** position at SmallTech LLC. With **10+ years of project management experience** and **PMP certification**, I recognize that my background exceeds the requirements for this role. However, I am genuinely interested in exploring opportunities with innovative technology companies where I can contribute **enterprise-grade project management expertise** while working closely with development teams on internal software projects.

**Why I am applying to SmallTech LLC:**

**Hands-On Contribution Opportunity:** After years of managing large-scale enterprise programs at major banks, I am interested in returning to a more **hands-on coordination role** where I can directly support development teams and contribute to product innovation. Your focus on **internal software projects** aligns with my desire to work closely with technical teams and see projects through from conception to delivery.

**Mentorship & Knowledge Transfer:** I can bring **enterprise best practices** in agile methodologies, project documentation, and stakeholder management to SmallTech LLC. My experience **coordinating between business and technical teams**, **managing project documentation**, and **facilitating agile ceremonies** can help establish robust project management practices while mentoring junior team members.

**Relevant Experience for This Role:**

Although my recent roles have been at a senior level, I have **direct experience in project coordination** from my early career at Dubai Islamic Bank (2012-2015), where I:
• **Coordinated project activities** between business units and technology teams
• **Managed project documentation**, status reports, and meeting minutes
• **Supported agile transformation initiatives** and facilitated team ceremonies
• **Tracked project milestones** and communicated progress to stakeholders
• **Maintained project management tools** and reporting dashboards

In my recent roles at **Emirates NBD** and **Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank**, I have:
• **Coordinated cross-functional teams** of 12-18 members across multiple projects
• **Managed project budgets** up to $8M with strict financial controls
• **Implemented Jira and Confluence**, improving team productivity by 25%
• **Ensured 100% on-time delivery** for 15+ enterprise projects
• **Facilitated agile ceremonies** including stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives

**What I Can Bring to SmallTech LLC:**

**Structured Project Management:** I can implement **agile methodologies** and **project governance** frameworks that will scale with your company's growth. My experience with **Jira, Confluence, and Azure DevOps** can streamline your project tracking and documentation processes.

**Stakeholder Communication:** My experience **managing executive stakeholders** and **coordinating between business and technical teams** ensures clear communication and alignment across all project participants.

**Risk Management & Quality Focus:** Enterprise banking has instilled a strong focus on **risk management**, **quality assurance**, and **regulatory compliance** - disciplines that can benefit any software development organization.

**Pragmatic Considerations:**

I want to be transparent about my background: I am currently a **Senior Project Manager** with significant enterprise experience. My interest in this role stems from a desire to:
• Work with **innovative technology products** rather than legacy banking systems
• Contribute in a **hands-on capacity** rather than purely strategic oversight
• Potentially **mentor and develop** junior project management talent
• Join a **growing company** where I can make a meaningful impact

I understand this position may be designed for someone earlier in their career, and I am open to discussing how my experience could be valuable to SmallTech LLC in a **coordination or senior coordinator capacity**.

**Additional Information:**
• **PMP Certified** and **Certified ScrumMaster**
• **MBA in Technology Management** and **Bachelor of Engineering**
• **Fluent in English and Arabic**
• **Dubai visa ready** - available for immediate joining
• **Remote work experience** - comfortable with distributed teams

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my **project management expertise** could contribute to SmallTech LLC's success, whether in this coordination role or another capacity that better fits my experience level. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Ahmed Nasr**
