**RE: Application for About the job Group Head of IT**

---

About_the_job_Group_Head_of_IT's strategic focus on transforming customer acquisition through seamless onboarding and alternate channel expansion represents exactly the type of large-scale transformation I have delivered throughout my career. I am writing to express my interest in this position.

**Why About_the_job_Group_Head_of_IT, Why Now**

Your mandate to simplify onboarding processes, scale digital and alternate acquisition channels, and deliver consistent customer experiences across physical and digital touchpoints mirrors the transformation I led at TopMed, where I achieved 95% adoption of AI-enabled patient onboarding across 10+ hospitals serving 2M+ patients. The challenge of unifying multiple channels under a single customer-centric framework requires both strategic vision and operational rigor—capabilities I have demonstrated leading 50+ person cross-functional teams and managing multi-country transformations.

**Relevant Executive Experience**

At PaySky, I delivered a merchant onboarding platform serving 500K+ businesses, reducing onboarding friction by 40% through process redesign and digital workflow implementation. I partnered directly with Risk and Compliance functions to embed KYC/AML verification requirements into seamless customer journeys—a direct parallel to the regulatory integration required in retail banking.

At Talabat, I scaled operations 233x across MENA, building the onboarding framework and capability infrastructure for a 100+ person team. This experience translating rapid growth into sustainable, consistent customer experiences aligns with your objectives to improve conversion and turnaround times while maintaining quality across channels.

**Leadership Approach**

I operate as a transformation partner to the business, not a functionary. My approach combines data-driven optimization with pragmatic change management. At TopMed, I worked directly with HR and L&D to build frontline capability, achieving adoption rates that exceeded targets. I understand that technology and process changes only deliver value when people are equipped and motivated to use them.

**Fit for About_the_job_Group_Head_of_IT's Priorities**

Your requirement for stakeholder management across Product, Technology, Operations, Risk, and Compliance matches my career pattern. I have consistently led at the intersection of these functions, translating business requirements into technical solutions while respecting regulatory and risk constraints. My MBA and commercial track record—delivering 3x profit increases and managing P&L responsibility—ensure I approach decisions with both customer and business outcomes in mind.

I am excited by the opportunity to bring this experience to About_the_job_Group_Head_of_IT's transformation agenda. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in onboarding transformation, alternate channel strategy, and cross-functional leadership can accelerate your customer acquisition objectives.

Respectfully,
