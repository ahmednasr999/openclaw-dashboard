Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding the VP Frontline Experience opportunity at RAKBANK. With 18+ years architecting digital onboarding journeys and scaling alternate acquisition channels across PaySky, TopMed, and Talabat, I've reduced onboarding TAT from 5 days to 24 hours while maintaining 99.9% compliance.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience harmonizing multi-channel customer experiences could support RAKBANK's retail growth objectives.

Best regards,
Ahmed Nasr

Dear [Name],

Thank you for connecting. I'm particularly interested in RAKBANK's innovation in digital banking and would love to learn more about the current priorities for the customer onboarding transformation.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss the VP Frontline Experience role and how my background in KYC/CDD optimization and channel diversification might align with your team's goals?

I'm available at your convenience this week or next.

Best regards,
Ahmed
