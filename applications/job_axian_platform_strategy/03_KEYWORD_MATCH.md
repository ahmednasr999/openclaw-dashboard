- ✅ API-first architecture (PaySky payment platform)
- ✅ Platform harmonization across multi-country operations
- ✅ Business requirements translation into technical features

**Multi-Country Operations:**

- ✅ Platform rollout across multiple markets
- ✅ Balancing standardization with local flexibility

### Gaps ⚠️

**Industry Domain:**
- ❌ **Telecom experience:** Healthcare/FinTech background, no telecom
- ❌ **BSS/OSS knowledge:** No billing/operations support systems experience
- ❌ **Telecom-specific metrics:** ARPU, churn (retention yes, but not telecom-framed)

**Technical Specifics:**
- ❌ **Salesforce/Dynamics:** No specific CRM platform certifications
- ❌ **Telecom commercial processes:** Different from healthcare/FinTech customer journeys

**Language:**
- ❌ **French:** Listed as desirable, not present

### Domain Transferability Analysis

**Highly Transferable:**
- Platform strategy and roadmap development ✓
- AI integration and data-driven enhancements ✓
- API-first architecture ✓
- Cross-functional collaboration ✓
- Vendor management ✓
- Multi-country platform harmonization ✓

**Requires Learning:**
- Telecom BSS/OSS ecosystem
- Telecom-specific customer processes (sales, onboarding, care)
- ARPU, churn, and telecom commercial metrics
- Salesforce/Dynamics specifics (if those are their platforms)

**Recommendation:**
The 78% score reflects strong platform strategy capabilities with acknowledged telecom domain gap. Your healthcare/FinTech platform experience is highly transferable to telecom—the concepts (CRM, omnichannel, AI, API-first) are identical, just different industry context.

## Recommendation

### **MODERATE-STRONG CANDIDATE** (78% ATS Score)

**Fit Analysis:**
This role values **platform strategy expertise** over **telecom-specific knowledge**. You have:
- Strong platform roadmap experience ✅
- AI integration track record ✅
- API-first architecture ✅
- Multi-country platform harmonization ✅
- Cross-functional leadership ✅

**The 22% gap is:**
- Telecom BSS/OSS terminology
- Industry-specific processes
- Salesforce/Dynamics (if required)

**Competitive Position:**
If Axian prioritizes **platform strategy skills** over **telecom background**, you're competitive. If they require **telecom insiders**, this is a stretch.

**Cover Letter Strategy:**
Lead with: "20+ years defining platform strategies for enterprise digital transformation across healthcare and FinTech sectors—industries with customer engagement complexity matching telecom's requirements."

Address gap: "While my direct telecom experience is limited, my platform strategy expertise in healthcare (patient lifecycle management) and FinTech (merchant engagement) directly translates to Axian's BSS, CRM, and omnichannel platform requirements."

Differentiate: "My cross-industry perspective brings proven platform harmonization methodologies from complex multi-stakeholder environments—applicable to Axian's OPCO standardization challenges."

*This CV maintains 100% factual accuracy. Healthcare/FinTech platform experience is genuinely transferable to telecom platform strategy, though specific BSS/OSS terminology and processes would require onboarding.*
