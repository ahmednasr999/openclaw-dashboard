**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the Senior Project Manager - Banking Transformation position. With 20+ years of experience leading large-scale banking transformation initiatives across GCC financial institutions, I am excited about the opportunity to drive meaningful change for your organization.

**Why This Role:**
Banking transformation in Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC region represents one of the most dynamic and impactful areas in financial services today. Under Vision 2030, the Kingdom's banking sector is undergoing unprecedented modernization, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to this historic transformation. The opportunity to lead complex transformation programs that will shape the future of banking in the region is exactly the challenge I am seeking.

**Relevant Experience:**

*Banking Transformation:* At Microsoft, I delivered digital banking transformation projects for 15+ banks across MENA, including core banking modernizations, digital channel implementations, and cloud migrations. These programs ranged from $5M to $50M in value and involved complex stakeholder management at C-suite level. I understand the unique challenges of banking transformation, from legacy system integration to regulatory compliance to change management.

*Program Management:* I currently lead a PMO overseeing 300+ projects with a portfolio value exceeding AED 50M. My experience includes establishing governance frameworks, managing cross-functional teams, and delivering consistent results. At Intel, I managed a $30M portfolio of banking and fintech transformation programs across EMEA.

*Technology Expertise:* I have deep knowledge of core banking systems (Temenos, Finacle, FLEXCUBE), digital banking platforms, payment systems, and regulatory reporting solutions. My current AI transformation experience positions me well to leverage emerging technologies in banking modernization.

*Regulatory Knowledge:* I have extensive experience with SAMA regulations, Basel III/IV compliance, and other banking regulatory frameworks across GCC. I understand the critical importance of maintaining compliance while driving innovation and can navigate the complex regulatory landscape effectively.

*Change Management:* Successful banking transformation requires more than technology implementation—it requires organizational change. I am certified in Prosci change management methodologies and have led numerous change initiatives, achieving high adoption rates and sustainable transformation outcomes.

**Value Proposition:**
I bring a proven track record of delivering complex banking transformation programs on time, within budget, and with measurable business outcomes. My combination of technical expertise, program management discipline, and stakeholder management skills positions me to drive successful transformation for your organization.

**Call to Action:**
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss your transformation priorities and how my experience can support your objectives. Please contact me at +971-XX-XXX-XXXX or via email to schedule a conversation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your transformation journey.

**Sincerely,**

Ahmed Nasr
