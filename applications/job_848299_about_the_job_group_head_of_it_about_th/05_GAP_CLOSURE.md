# SECTION 5: HOW TO CLOSE GAPS STRATEGICALLY

**Immediate (Pre-Application):**

1. **Add "Retail Banking" Context:**
   - In PaySky experience, explicitly state "Retail Banking & FinTech" to capture sector terminology (PaySky is payment solutions—accurate positioning)

2. **Insert Digital Identity:**
   - Add "digital identity verification" to TopMed experience where you mention patient digital engagement platforms—accurate as healthcare onboarding requires identity verification

3. **Add Conversion Language:**
   - In Talabat experience, ensure "conversion rates" and "turnaround times" are explicit—matches JD language exactly

**Interview Preparation:**

4. **Knowledge Demonstration:**
   - Research About_the_job_Group_Head_of_IT's specific onboarding pain points through news/LinkedIn
   - Prepare case study: "How I would apply PaySky's 40% friction reduction approach to retail banking onboarding"
   - Study UAE Central Bank KYC/AML guidelines for retail banking

5. **Positioning Strategy:**
   - Lead with transformation expertise
   - Frame banking vertical as application of proven methodology
   - Emphasize onboarding complexity solved, not industry-specific knowledge gaps
